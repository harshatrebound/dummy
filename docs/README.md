# TeamSync Pro - Technical Architecture

This document provides a detailed explanation of the TeamSync Pro system architecture. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and follows modern best practices for web application development.

## System Overview

TeamSync Pro is built using a modern stack consisting of:
- Frontend: Next.js 13+ with App Router
- Backend: Directus Headless CMS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- External Services: Various third-party integrations

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (Next.js)

#### Core Components
- **Layout Components**: Reusable layout structures (Header, Footer, etc.)
- **UI Components**: Atomic design components (Button, Input, Modal, etc.)
- **Section Components**: Larger composite components for page sections

#### Pages
- Home
- Activities
- Events
- Blog
- About
- Contact

#### Features
- Authentication
- Team Management
- Activity Booking
- Analytics Dashboard
- User Profiles

### 2. Backend (Directus)

#### Database (PostgreSQL)
Collections:
- Users
- Teams
- Activities
- Events
- Bookings
- Analytics
- Blog Posts

#### Services
- Directus API
- Authentication Service
- File Storage
- Webhooks

### 3. External Services
- Email Service: For transactional emails
- Payment Gateway: For processing payments
- Analytics Service: For tracking user behavior
- CDN: For serving static assets

## Key Flows

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits site
2. Router checks authentication status
3. Auth component validates with AuthService
4. AuthService queries database
5. Auth status returned to Router
6. Access granted or denied

### Data Flow
1. User browses activities
2. Frontend requests data from API
3. API queries database
4. Data returned to frontend
5. Frontend displays data

### Booking Flow
1. User initiates booking
2. Booking created through API
3. Payment processed
4. Booking stored in database
5. Confirmation email sent

### Analytics Flow
1. Events tracked through Analytics Service
2. Data stored in database
3. Reports generated through API
4. Data displayed in Analytics Dashboard

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are protected
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits

## Performance Optimizations

- Static page generation where possible
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- CDN for static assets
- Caching strategies
- Optimized database queries

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Shared components in dedicated directories
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **State Management**
   - React Context for global state
   - Local state for component-specific data
   - Server state management with React Query

3. **Styling**
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Custom design system
   - Responsive design principles

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for features
   - E2E tests for critical flows

5. **Deployment**
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Staging and production environments
   - Automated testing before deployment

## Future Considerations

- Internationalization support
- Advanced analytics features
- Mobile app development
- AI-powered recommendations
- Real-time collaboration features
